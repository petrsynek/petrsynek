My vocation is programming/problem-solving, which I currently do in Python, Django, Postgre but has also done in Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Elastic, and more...
Tools that I am used to working with git, command-line/shell (win or Linux), Docker (docker-compose)

My professional experience range from commercial software architecture design to science-related highly specific programs, from deployment using virtual machines to running and orchestrating Docker containers.
I have also spent some time with image, instrumental and statistical data processing, using various approaches and algorithms, eg. regression analysis, and statistical analysis.
And by the way, I know a lot about the ups and downs of experimental physics. 

On github I store some small projects, here you can find biggest opensource project I have developed vyth my friend Jan Vorac https://bitbucket.org/OES_muni/massiveoes/src/master/
